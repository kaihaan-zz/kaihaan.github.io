# The Slow Road

With everything in flux, speed, flexibility and change seem to be the only constants. What if they are misleading, even wrong? In the worlds of food and fashion 'slow' is the counter-culture to 'fast'. A relative may have counselled you to measure twice and cut once. After the recent crash, we bemoaned an 'overheated' economy. And the tortoise wins every time. Let's look at the leaders of 'fast'. When was the last major transformation you noticed in Google's search engine or Amazon's online shop?

**The Optimus Prime Siren**

Champions for change everywhere are desperate for a catalyst. It is part of their character to see the Optimus Prime where everyone else sees an articulated truck. They have experienced the pain of frustrated attempts to change. The liberating siren-call of a 'moonshot' inspires them.

To push this analogy to destruction, there's a catch. Optimus Prime is a fictional character. Almost no businesses have a nascent new form waiting to bust out.

Many leaders have come to a bitter conclusion; the only way to change culture is to replace the people. This must be the nuclear option and at best only part of the solution. It's a pragmatic but brutal response.

**Steady Not Supersonic**

So what if the conventional-wisdom of transformation is wrong? Or only partially right? Much of 'agile-style' thinking has come from software development. Here's a little-understood truth: agile-developed software doesn't change much. In product and customer experience terms, the goal is to have a 'stable release' as fast as possible. Often that isn't in truth particularly fast.

Somehow the idea of sprints, backlogs and stand-ups have become "5 months work in 5 days". The confused expectations are punishing well-intentioned teams.

For experienced software professionals, agile is a way to avoid over-promise and under-deliver. It should be faster in the long run. In practice, it is more 'minimising waste' than a 'massive acceleration'.

**The Slow Road**

If you are a sci-fi geek, you may have heard of the apocryphal "Kuang Grade Mark Eleven Penetration Program". If not, then run immediately to your nearest kindle!

This is a fictional hacker's virus. Instead of breaking down defensive barriers, it morphs itself into its target. Once it gets past the outer defences, it progressively accelerates with devastating effect.

This idea has a lot of cultural and human truth. The need for speed runs the risk of collapsing under its accelerative stresses. The alternative isn't 'leaving well enough alone'. It is the slow road to change.

On this path, the Optimus Prime siren call is embraced, but the reassurance of 'slowly does it' is strongly emphasised.

Acceleration is anticipated for the future but the present-day all about intensive support and coaching for people bravely facing the unknown.
