# Unblocking for Agile

Leaders need to bust the organisational blockers to Agile

Agile has spread from its origins in software development into every aspect of a modern enterprise. By now, most people will have enjoyed a ‘scrum’, ‘retrospective’, ‘stand-up’ or ‘show and tell’. Performing Agile rituals will start to build muscle memory. Yet rituals alone can not create sustainable change.

Creating special-project squads allows the use of Agile methods to build Agile culture. These teams uncover organisational issues which every leader needs to address:

**1. Catatonic current state**

This is a legacy of centralised planning and ‘MECE’ (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive) thinking. Business units become incapable of sharing intelligence or effectively collaborating. This is a value-delivery problem when customer journeys are rarely owned by one unit.

**2. Unhealthy competition and conflicting KPIs amongst leadership**

Annual planning negotiations can create KPIs which are good for each leader but bad for joined-up working.

**3. Conflicting ideas of what ‘agile’ should be**

Agile playbooks make it easy to focus on a part rather than the whole. The danger that sucessful Agile might lead to a reorg can hold teams back from making process improvements.

## **Leaders must expect these issues and remove the root-cause problems.**

Here are some tactics taken from recent work:

**Very Senior Permission to Bust the Blockers**

Most newbie Agile teams will hit a blocker that under business-as-usual rules would be immovable. No matter how the blocker is busted, there must be Very Senior aircover. Without this energetic, bold and visionary leadership ‘Agile’ will become ‘why we chose to solve a smaller problem’.

Typically, the aircover needs to be from a source that commands universal respect.

**Unified Measurement Framework — aligned to Customer Journeys and Sprint Priorities (OKRs)**

In practice leadership KPIs often resolve down to sales and growth metrics. To avoid exposing leaders to unfair criticism, they avoid exposing process measures. Yet the secret of Agile is maxmising process performance.

A measurement framework that would unblock cross-journey collaboration needs to be unified across business units. It needs to:

* have both global outcomes and journey-stage or value-chain-step specific performance measures

* align its measures with the customer journey

* have clear RACI for each measure

* be used during annual planning to align Agile work priorities against KPIs (OKRs are useful for this)

**Annual Customer Experience Planning**

Customer experience planning is often used for special projects. Its use as a regular and essential part of annual planning remains rare. Leaders must urgently change this. This is the only way to establish coherant roadmaps. The unified roadmaps create the leadership context to allow Agile teams to be effective.

The most effective way to approach corporate growth planning with Agile is to start with a customer experience vision. All strategic activities, whether they are driving efficiencies or growth, are then in service of this vision. Without this principle efficiency may become the enemy of growth.

**Making Heroes of the Awkward Squad**

Agile should create energy and excitement. It should continually gather momentum. It should continually build its squad of advocates. Yet often it can feel very hard. Leaders must recognise and reward the heavy lifting needed to gain momentum with Agile. They must find and reward the outlier individuals who are awkward enough to take on a very hard job and to thrive with the challenge.

**Keep going back to first principles**

It is quite amazing how a manifesto for the very specialist world of software proves very translatable into other fields. It is often forgotten as the theory of Agile continues to grow — but returning to the origins in the [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) continues to prove instructive.
