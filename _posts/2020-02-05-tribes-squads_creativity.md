# Tribes, Squads & Creativity

too much DevOps, not enough creative-culture

* starts with the customer experience and works back

* contrast creative with rational

### **'How we Work' unlocks growth**

A recent case study review showed up to x4 revenue growth when sales and marketing teams adopt agile. The benefits increase when sales, marketing, and product follow agile together.

The approach starts with the customer experience. Then it tracks back through product, sales and marketing. It also projects forward into a lifetime relationship.

Often the CX-design process throws up new capability needs. Managing these often causes the greatest challenge.

Investors are urging digital investment to improve customer experience and cut costs.

The investor view is often sceptical of product or service innovation. It is also often confident about efficiency and intensification benefits. This is putting pressure on leaders to show progress with digital investments. In turn, this puts pressure on business units to adopt new ways of working.

### Culture Vs Operational Design

Alfred Sloan designed the canonical organisational model for General Motors. It creates efficiencies through distributing responsibilities amongst business units. These work well for products which amortise significant up-front investment. Yet the same business unit structures block agile ways of working.

This is the same point identified by Eric Ries in his book 'The Startup Way'. In this he identifies two complementary ways of working which are both needed, the 'Continuous Innovation' model, managed using a 'general management' mindset, and the 'Continuous Transformation' model, managed using an entrepreneurial management mindset.

Realising the benefits of digital technology investments needs new ways of working. 80% of leaders at a World Economic Forum workshop identified 'ways of working' as the key challenge.

Yet, as Peter Drucker counsels 'Culture eats strategy for breakfast'. This very significant challenge faces almost all industries and every scale of organisation.

Much of the language of agile transformation comes from the world of 'Dev Ops'. Strategic thought leaders searching for measurable and scalable efficiencies have adopted the narrative.

This has the unintended consequence of pushing creativity out of management thinking.

### Learning from Experience

Evolutional change in 'ways of working' marks the progress of 'digital'. For example:

1. Get in the game: Establish an e-commerce site, set a target for digital sales

1. Lab: power innovation by a new and separate 'lab' unit*

1. Accelerator: power innovation by involving existing teams in an annual accelerator program*

1. Ventures: establish a separate unit to invest in start-ups

1. Transformation Unit: establish a new vertical with responsibility for transformation*

1. Digital Unit: establish a new vertical with responsibility for digital*

1. Hub & Spoke: create an innovative format that grows organically within the organisation*

** a kind of 'centre of excellence'*

All these models have created valuable results and insights. Yet none on their own have emerged as the'Killer App'.

The most recent organisational method to emerge is 'Tribes and Squads'. Spotify pioneered it as a Dev Ops model, and ING as an agile transformation approach.

### Creative vs Rational

'Tribes & Squads' recreates digital design studio ways of working within the enterprise environment.

This matches project feedback across several industries. Here, introducing user experience design and research had the greatest impact.

These project reviews also show the most common blocker has been **'ways of working'**. The greatest being gaps between business units.

Many businesses have created a 'design centre of excellence' intended to reduce costs. Using design skills for strategic planning would have a greater growth impact.

The major challenge facing enterprises is the enterprise culture. New talent runs a risk of 'going native'. Yet vendors/partners may not support a 'continuous transformation' programme.

Enterprises, consultancies, marketing and designer need to evolve their skillsets. The role of creativity is vital. Yet it is not the same type of creativity used to design a website or TV spot. The role of a strategist is vital, yet it is not the same type of strategy used to define growth targets.

The cultural dynamic needed is the generative tension between creative and rational thinking.

### Change at the Speed of Culture

'Change at the speed of culture' captures an idea that retail customers neither care about nor are waiting on businesses to change.

For this piece, we will exclude the external pilot and pivot approach. In this model, there is an assumption that internal change will be too slow-moving. The solution is then to pilot new ways of working outside the cultural walls. The strategy is to gradually pivot tasks from the incumbent into the startup.

It is unusual for businesses to have the luxury of ignoring their legacy revenue streams. They need an analogous internal change approach.

We may repurpose 'at the speed of culture' for changes to internal culture. While consumer culture moves fast, workplace culture does not. Security of income and status are too sensitive to be entertaining.

![Pilots focus on building familiarity and cultural momentum amongst a core with 'new ways of working'](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3646/1*6FcmN4_PEbI-MWyqLzh_3Q.png)*Pilots focus on building familiarity and cultural momentum amongst a core with 'new ways of working'*

Introducing agile methods brings a wave of energy, optimism and belief. Often followed by an 'adoption chasm' when optimism meets operational realities.

To prevent premature death, we need to prevent a breaking point of cultural rejection. Participants should be carefully selected 'early adopters' and advocates.

A small group should be shepherded through the process and build their own culture. New colleagues can then be welcomed into a positive change from the usual.

This pilot is a seed to build around. This means starting with a single squad and adding new squads, then new tribes over time.

### Start with Product

Agile methods are often introduced in transformation units, technology or digital teams. However, which unit leads can open a problem.

At the heart of agile and design thinking is being customer experience-centric. Strategies may define scope but only real customer behaviours prove the case.

![Using a shared vision to align Product, Sales, Marketing and Customer Service units](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3402/1*BDHRPlOrs9_MM2Lqkpy3Cw.png)*Using a shared vision to align Product, Sales, Marketing and Customer Service units*

With this in mind, agile CX ways of working should start with the customer experience. This means starting with the product. Then following the value chain back to sales, marketing, and service.

This creates alignment around proven needs, behaviours and purchase drivers. With this approach, businesses can create experiences to fall in love with.
